     * The expression a sort property orders by.

     * <p>Every property sorts by its own column except {@code priority}, which sorts by severity.
     *
     * <p><strong>Why that needs an expression.</strong> {@code Priority} is mapped
     * {@code @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)}, so the column holds {@code 'LOW'}, {@code 'MEDIUM'},
     * {@code 'HIGH'}, {@code 'CRITICAL'} and the database sorts it as text. Ascending gave
     * CRITICAL, HIGH, LOW, MEDIUM; {@code ?sort=priority,desc} - the obvious way to ask for "worst
     * first" - gave MEDIUM, LOW, HIGH, CRITICAL, putting the least urgent ticket at the top of a
     * triage queue. Nothing failed and nothing was logged; the list was simply wrong in the one place
     * a support queue is read.
     *
     * <p>Unlike most of the open questions in this codebase this one needs no business decision:
     * {@code Priority} is an ordered scale by its nature, and its declaration order
     * {@code LOW < MEDIUM < HIGH < CRITICAL} already states the severity. The {@code CASE} is built
     * from {@code Priority.values()}, so a new level inserted in the enum is ranked correctly without
     * touching this method.
     *
     * <p><strong>{@code status} is deliberately left alone.</strong> It has the same string-ordering
     * behaviour, but {@code TicketStatus} is not a scale - it is a set of lifecycle states whose legal
     * order is the undecided business question in audit P1-5, and {@code REOPENED} and {@code PENDING}
     * sit at the end of the enum precisely because no sequence was agreed. Ranking it by declaration
     * order would be inventing that sequence. Sorting by status still groups equal statuses together,
     * which is what it is useful for; it just does not claim to be lifecycle order. The same applies
     * to {@code role} on the user listing.
     *
     * <p><strong>No performance change.</strong> Ordering by an expression cannot use an index, but
     * ordering by the {@code priority} column could not either: V12 records that a
     * {@code (priority, created_at DESC, id DESC)} index was built, measured, chosen by the planner
     * zero times and discarded, because four distinct values over 20,000 rows never beat
     * {@code idx_tickets_created_at_id}. This replaces an unindexed column sort with an unindexed
     * expression sort over the same rows.
