/**
 * Flat read projection for ticket queries - exactly the columns {@code TicketResponse} needs and
 * nothing else.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why a projection rather than entities.</strong> The list endpoint used to call
 * {@code findAll()}, which loads {@code Ticket} entities whose three {@code @ManyToOne} associations
 * are {@code EAGER}. Spring Data's {@code findAll} issues {@code select t from Ticket t}, and
 * Hibernate resolves eager to-one associations in HQL results with follow-up selects rather than a
 * join - producing one extra query per distinct referenced user and application. Measured worst case:
 * 200 tickets to 401 statements.
 *
 * <p>Selecting into this record makes Hibernate emit a single query with explicit joins, and loads
 * <em>no managed entities at all</em>: nothing enters the persistence context, nothing is
 * dirty-checked, and only the three name columns actually rendered in the response are read from the
 * associated tables.
 *
 * <p>It is a separate type from {@code TicketResponse} on purpose. Binding JPQL constructor
 * expressions straight to the response DTO would couple the query to that DTO's field order, so
 * reordering a field in the API model would silently shuffle values between columns. Mapping through
 * this record costs one allocation per row and makes such a mistake a compile error instead.
