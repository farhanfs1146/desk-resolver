/**
 * Hand-built read queries for the ticket list.
 *
 * <p>This exists because of a measured problem with the obvious alternative. A single static JPQL
 * query using the familiar {@code (:param is null or column = :param)} idiom produces one SQL
 * statement for every filter combination, which is convenient - but the resulting SQL is not
 * plan-stable. Measured against 20,000 tickets:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   custom plan  (parameters known)   Index Scan using idx_tickets_created_at_id        145 buffers
 *   generic plan (parameters opaque)  Seq Scan + Hash joins + top-N heapsort         86,026 buffers
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>PostgreSQL's default {@code plan_cache_mode = auto} keeps choosing the custom plan here, because
 * the generic estimate is much more expensive - so the cliff is not reached today. But that safety
 * rests entirely on cost estimates staying that way as data grows, and the PostgreSQL JDBC driver
 * switches to server-side prepared statements after five executions of a statement, which is what
 * makes the generic plan reachable at all. Depending on an estimate to avoid a 590x regression is not
 * a property worth shipping.
 *
 * <p>Building the predicates dynamically removes the question: each filter combination produces SQL
 * that mentions only the filters actually supplied, so there is no opaque parameter for the planner to
 * guess around and every plan is the custom plan.
