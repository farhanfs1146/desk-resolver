/**
 * Thrown when a request body references an entity that does not exist - for example creating a
 * ticket for an unknown {@code applicationId}, or assigning one to an unknown user.
 *
 * <p>Distinguished from {@link ResourceNotFoundException} on purpose: the resource the caller
 * addressed does exist (or is being created), but a value *inside* their payload is wrong. That is a
 * 400, not a 404 - the URL was fine, the body was not. Previously both produced HTTP 500
 * (audit finding P0-6).
