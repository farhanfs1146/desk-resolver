     * <p>The two thresholds are deliberately different sizes, and the reasoning matters more than the
     * numbers:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>{@code maxAccountFailures = 5} — what actually protects one password. Five is comfortably
     *       above honest mistakes (a typo, an old password, the wrong one of two accounts) and far below
     *       anything useful for guessing: against even a 10,000-entry password list it buys an attacker
     *       0.05% of the list per window.
     *   <li>{@code maxAddressFailures = 20} — looser because addresses are legitimately shared. An office
     *       behind NAT is a single address for everyone in it, so a tight per-address limit would let a
     *       few colleagues fumbling passwords lock out the whole building. Twenty absorbs that while
     *       still stopping a single host spraying many accounts.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>{@code window = 15m} with {@code blockDuration = 15m} keeps the block short and
     * self-clearing. An indefinite lockout would hand an attacker a denial-of-service: anyone who knows
     * a colleague's email could keep their account locked forever. Fifteen minutes makes sustained
     * guessing impractical (20 attempts/hour against one account) while capping the damage of a targeted
     * nuisance attack at fifteen minutes.
     *
     * @param enabled               master switch; leave on outside focused testing
     * @param maxAccountFailures    failures within the window before that account is blocked
     * @param maxAddressFailures    failures within the window before that address is blocked
     * @param window                sliding window over which failures are counted
     * @param blockDuration         how long a block lasts once tripped
     * @param maxTrackedKeys        per-dimension cap on tracked keys, bounding memory
     * @param trustForwardedHeaders only enable behind a proxy that appends {@code X-Forwarded-For}
