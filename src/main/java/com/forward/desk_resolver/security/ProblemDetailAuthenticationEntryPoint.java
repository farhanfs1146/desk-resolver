/**
 * Emits <strong>401 Unauthorized</strong> as an RFC 7807 problem document when a request carries no
 * usable credentials.
 *
 * <p>Two things this gets right that the default does not. First the status code: Phase 2 returned 400
 * for a missing identity because no authentication scheme existed and advertising 401 would have
 * implied one. Now that authentication is real, 401 is correct and 403 is reserved for an authenticated
 * caller who simply lacks the permission.
 *
 * <p>Second, the response says nothing useful to an attacker. Whether the token was absent, malformed,
 * expired or signed with the wrong key all produce the same body; the distinction is logged at debug
 * level instead. No stack trace, no class name, no hint about the signing algorithm.
