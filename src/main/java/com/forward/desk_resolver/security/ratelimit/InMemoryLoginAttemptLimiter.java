/**
 * In-process, sliding-window login throttle with two independent dimensions.
 *
 * <h2>Two dimensions, and why both are needed</h2>
 *
 * Either one alone is bypassable:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>Per-account only</strong> — an attacker spreads attempts across many addresses and the
 *       per-address budget never applies. Account throttling is what actually protects a single
 *       password.
 *   <li><strong>Per-address only</strong> — an attacker rotates addresses (a botnet, or simply a cloud
 *       provider) and each fresh address gets a full budget against the same account.
 * </ul>
 *
 * So both are enforced, and the first to trip refuses the attempt. The per-address budget is the looser
 * of the two because addresses are legitimately shared: an office behind NAT is one address for
 * everybody, and a handful of colleagues mistyping passwords must not lock the building out.
 *
 * <h2>Counting the submitted string, not the resolved account</h2>
 *
 * The account dimension is keyed on the <em>email the caller submitted</em>, normalised, whether or not
 * it matches a real user. This is deliberate and it is a security property, not an implementation
 * convenience: if only real accounts were throttled, then a 429 would prove an account exists and the
 * limiter would hand back exactly the enumeration oracle that the uniform 401 was built to remove.
 * Normalisation (trim, lower-case) stops {@code Admin@x.test} and {@code admin@x.test} being counted as
 * two different budgets.
 *
 * <h2>Memory</h2>
 *
 * Keys are attacker-supplied, so unbounded growth would be a denial-of-service vector in a component
 * whose job is to prevent one. Two bounds apply:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Entries expire: anything whose window and block have both elapsed is dead weight and is swept.
 *   <li>A hard cap on entry count. When exceeded, expired entries are swept first and, if still over,
 *       the entries with the oldest windows are evicted.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Eviction rather than rejection is the deliberate choice. Refusing to track new keys once full would
 * let an attacker fill the map with junk and then either evade throttling entirely (if we fail open) or
 * deny login to everyone (if we fail closed). Eviction degrades gracefully instead: with the default cap
 * an attacker would need to sustain tens of thousands of distinct keys inside the window to start
 * displacing real entries, and would be fighting the per-address limit the whole time.
 *
 * <h2>Thread safety</h2>
 *
 * All mutation happens inside {@link ConcurrentHashMap#compute}, so each key's update is atomic under
 * the map's own per-bin lock. The stored value is an immutable record, so nothing can be observed
 * half-updated. There is no {@code synchronized} block and no non-thread-safe collection.
