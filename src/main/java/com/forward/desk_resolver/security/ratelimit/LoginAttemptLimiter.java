/**
 * Tracks failed login attempts and refuses further ones once a threshold is crossed.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this is an interface.</strong> The current implementation keeps its counters in the
 * application's own memory, which protects a single instance only. When this application runs as more
 * than one instance, each would enforce the limits independently and an attacker spreading attempts
 * across instances would get a correspondingly higher effective budget. Replacing this with a shared
 * store is then a matter of providing a different bean - nothing in {@code AuthServiceImpl} changes.
 * The limitation is stated plainly in docs/DECISIONS.md rather than glossed over.
 *
 * <p>Implementations must be thread-safe: login is unauthenticated and therefore trivially easy to
 * call concurrently.
