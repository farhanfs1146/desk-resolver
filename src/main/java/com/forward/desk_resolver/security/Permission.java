/**
 * The capabilities this application actually has, expressed as granted authorities.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why permissions rather than roles in the checks.</strong> Endpoints are guarded by
 * permission (`hasAuthority("TICKET_ASSIGN")`) instead of by role (`hasRole("IT_SUPPORT")`). The role
 * stays the thing stored against a user; the permission is what the code asserts. That means changing
 * which roles may assign a ticket is an edit to {@link RolePermissions} rather than a hunt through
 * controllers, and a new role can be introduced without touching a single authorization expression.
 *
 * <p><strong>Why this list and no more.</strong> One permission per capability the API already
 * exposes, and these cover every endpoint it has. (This sentence used to assert an endpoint count,
 * which was already wrong and went further out of date the moment an endpoint was added - a number
 * nothing verifies is a comment that rots.) No speculative permissions for
 * features that do not exist (comments, attachments, SLA, reporting), because an unused permission is
 * an untested permission.
