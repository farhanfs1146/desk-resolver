 * A user changing their own password.

 * to take an account over permanently - the attacker would still have to know the password to replace
 * it.
 *
 * <p>The length rule on {@code newPassword} is deliberately the same as
 * {@code CreateUserRequest.password}: a password set through this endpoint must meet the same bar as
 * one an administrator sets, or the weaker path becomes the one everybody uses.
